## 🔍 Overview

​ALM-LED​ is an autonomous drone system designed for ​high-precision 3D mapping in GPS-denied underground environments​ (e.g., mines, tunnels, caves). It integrates:

​1.LiDAR-SLAM​ for real-time localization and mapping

​2.Anti-collision design​ for obstacle avoidance in confined spaces

​3.Luojia Explorer Drone Platform​ (custom hardware)

​4.Autonomous path planning​ for efficient coverage
